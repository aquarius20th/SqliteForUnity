# SqliteForUnity3D
Sqlite3 for Unity3d with AES encryption

After trying out alot of sqlite3 libs/plugins for Unity3D, I couldn't find any that supported encryption, was free and was easy to use. However there were some good ones out there that I forked and added encrption support to it.

Quick Facts: 
1. SqliteForUnity3D provides sqlite support for Unity3D (5.0 & 4.6 Pro) with encryption
2. Download project folders to try out the sample scenes
3. Support for x86/x64/Android
4. Plugins folder contains SqliteForUnity3D.dll,libsqlite3.so(for Android),sqlite.dll(both x86/x64) with encrpytion support

# SqliteForUnity3D
SqliteForUnity3D is a fork of https://github.com/codecoding/SQLite4Unity3d by @CodeCoding. Its a small wrapper around the great c# library "sqlite-net" - https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net by @praeclarum


#TODO
1. To add support for Windows Phone 8.1/8
2. To test it on iOS
